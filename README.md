## Event Extraction
- **Situation Recognition: Visual Semantic Role Labeling for Image Understanding;** Mark Yatskar et al; Focus on image understanding. Given images, do the semantic role labeling task. No text available. A new benchmark and baseline are proposed. 
- **Cross-media Structured Common Space for Multimedia Event Extraction;** Manling Li et al; Focus on image-text event extraction. A new benchmark and baseline are proposed. 
- **CLIP-Event: Connecting Text and Images with Event Structures;** Manling Li et al; The new model CLIP-Event, specifically designed for multi-modal event extraction. Introducing new pretraining tasks to enable a strong zero-shot performance. 
- **GAIA: A Fine-grained Multimedia Knowledge Extraction System;** Manling Li et al; Demo paper. Extract knowledge (relation, event) from multimedia data. 


## Planning
